FROM node:22-alpine AS builder

RUN npm ci

RUN npm run build

# 2) Export-only stage. Pull just the built file out to the host:
#    docker build --target artifact -o dist .
#    -> writes ./dist/index.html (nothing else, no node, no layers).
FROM scratch AS artifact

# 3) Static server for local/prod. http://localhost:<port> is a WebAuthn
#    secure context, so the served container is fully usable for dev/testing:
#    docker build --target serve -t hindsight . && docker run -p 8080:80 hindsight
